Module Manifest File (__manifest__.py):
The module's manifest file is a Python file that provides essential information about the module and its dependencies. It contains metadata such as the module's name, version, author, description, and other technical details. It also defines the module's dependencies on other modules, both within Odoo's core modules and external addons.

Module Directory Structure:
Each Odoo module resides in its own directory. The module directory structure typically consists of the following files and directories:

>> __init__.py: An empty file that signifies the module as a Python package.

>> models/: Contains Python classes representing the module's data models and business logic.

>> views/: Holds XML files defining the module's user interface, including forms, lists, and other views.

>> security/: Contains XML files defining access control rules and security settings.

>> data/: Stores static data files, such as XML files for preloading data during module installation.

>> static/: Contains static web assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files.

>> controllers/: If the module includes web controllers, they are placed here.

>> reports/: Holds report templates, such as PDF or HTML templates, for generating printable reports.

>> wizard/: If the module includes wizard or dialog boxes, their definitions are placed here.

>> demo/: Contains demo data files used for populating the system with sample data.


Module Dependencies:
Odoo allows modules to define dependencies on other modules. These dependencies ensure that the required modules are installed and loaded before the dependent module. Dependencies are specified in the module's manifest file using the depends key.

Inheritance and Extension:
Odoo modules can extend or modify the functionality of other modules through inheritance. Inheritance enables you to add or override fields, methods, views, and other components of existing modules, without modifying their original code. This approach helps in maintaining compatibility during upgrades and updates.

Overall, the module structure in Odoo promotes modular development, reusability, and maintainability. It allows developers to encapsulate specific functionalities, manage dependencies, and extend the system's capabilities as per their requirements.



***Models and basic fields Creation***
>> at this point it is still an empty shell which doesn’t allow us to store any data. In our real estate module, we want to store the information related to the properties (name, description, price, living area…) in a database. The Odoo framework provides tools to facilitate database interactions.

>> Before moving forward in the exercise, make sure the estate module is installed, i.e. it must appear as ‘Installed’ in the Apps list. 


<!-- Do not use mutable global variables. -->

A single Odoo instance can run several databases in parallel within the same python process. Distinct modules might be installed on each of these databases, therefore we cannot rely on global variables that would be updated depending on installed modules.


***Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)***

>> A key component of Odoo is the ORM layer. This layer avoids having to manually write most SQL and provides extensibility and security services[2].

>> Business objects are declared as Python classes extending Model, which integrates them into the automated persistence system.

>> Models can be configured by setting attributes in their definition. The most important attribute is _name, which is required and defines the name for the model in the Odoo system. Here is a minimum definition of a model:

>> This definition is enough for the ORM to generate a database table named test_model. The . in the model _name is automatically converted into a _ by the ORM. By convention all models are located in a models directory and each model is defined in its own Python file.

>> The model is defined as estate_property.py

>> The file estate_property.py is imported in estate/models/__init__.py (from . import estate_property)

>> The folder models is imported in estate/__init__.py (from . import models)


***Model fields***

>> Fields are used to define what the model can store and where they are stored. Fields are defined as attributes in the model class:


<!--relativedelta its use full in date time operations-->

<!--XML, SQL(join ne badhu), odoo, odoo errors, python-->

field types, types of views, [notebook > page], <group expand="1">, ir.ui.view, domain="[('active', '=', True)]", context="{'group_by':'postcode'}", widget="many2many_tags", readonly="1", editable="bottom", ir.actions.act_window, <menuitem>


<!-- computed fields and Onchages -->
->> Compute fields use depends and we have to write compute attribute inside field we want to compute. inverse attribute uses to call reverse function of compute function.


EX:-

amount = field.Float()
total = field.Float(compute="_compute_total", inverse="_inverse_total")

@api.depends('amount')
def _compute_total(self):
	for record in self:
		record.total = record.amount * 2.0

def _inverse_total(self):
	for record in self:
		record.amount = record.total / 2.0


>> Computed fields are not stored in the database by default. Therefore it is not possible to search on a computed field unless a search method is defined.

>> Another solution is to store the field with the store=True attribute. While this is usually convenient, pay attention to the potential computation load added to your model.


description = fields.Char(compute="_compute_description", store=True)
partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner")

@api.depends("partner_id.name")
def _compute_description(self):
    for record in self:
        record.description = "Test for partner %s" % record.partner_id.name


->> [Onchange] In our real estate module, we also want to help the user with data entry. When the ‘garden’ field is set, we want to give a default value for the garden area as well as the orientation. Additionally, when the ‘garden’ field is unset we want the garden area to reset to zero and the orientation to be removed. In this case, the value of a given field modifies the value of other fields.


ex:-

name = fields.Char(string="Name")
description = fields.Char(string="Description")
partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")

@api.onchange("partner_id")
def _onchange_partner_id(self):
    self.name = "Document for %s" % (self.partner_id.name)
    self.description = "Default description for %s" % (self.partner_id.name)
